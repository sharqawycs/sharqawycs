# Heyy!

This GitHub looks _empty_?

---

Most of my projects are private because they’re **_closed-source_**. That includes startup code, tools I built for myself, and experiments I’m not ready to share yet. Some of them handle sensitive data, and some are part of bigger products I’m still working on.

If you’re _curious_ about what I’ve built, or wanna collaborate, just <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sharqawycs@gmail.com">DM me.</a> I’ve got demos, writeups, and code I can share privately.

I’m also into cognitive science, neuroscience, and how tech can be used to build better tools for different kinds of minds. It’s a _long-term goal_. For now, I’m just putting in the reps and building the foundation.
